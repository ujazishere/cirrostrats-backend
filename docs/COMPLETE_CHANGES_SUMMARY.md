# during project cleanup (October 2025)
# Old path: r'C:\Users\ujasv\OneDrive\Desktop\codes\cirrostrats-backend\all_US_airports_dict.pkl'
# New path: Uses relative path from core/extras/ to data/ directory
airports = r'../../data/all_US_airports_dict.pkl'
```

- Dual data organization strategy detailed
- General vs core-specific data separation rationale
- Environment portability benefits

**Lines 41-65:** Updated paths with detailed comments:
```python
# RESTRUCTURING UPDATE: Paths updated to reflect new directory structure
# General data files (all_US_airports_dict.pkl) moved to data/ directory
# Core-specific files (airport_identifiers_US.pkl) remain in core/pkl/ directory
# Old paths: 'dj_app/root/pkl/' and 'dj/dj_app/root/pkl/'
# New paths: Use relative paths from current file location

django_path = '../../data/all_US_airports_dict.pkl'  # From core/WIPs/ to data/
external_path = '../../data/all_US_airports_dict.pkl'  # From core/WIPs/ to data/
django_path_id = '../pkl/airport_identifiers_US.pkl'  # From core/WIPs/ to core/pkl/
external_path_id = '../pkl/airport_identifiers_US.pkl'  # From core/WIPs/ to core/pkl/
```

**Lines 67-101:** Added comprehensive pickle file processing comments:
```python
# ACTIVE PICKLE FILE PROCESSING: Airport Identifiers (3-letter codes)
# 
# WHAT THIS DOES:
# - Loads airport_identifiers_US.pkl containing ~20,296 airport IDs
# - Filters for 3-letter airport codes only (IATA format)
# - Creates a list of 3-letter identifiers for further processing
#
# FILE DETAILS:
# - Source: core/pkl/airport_identifiers_US.pkl (core-specific data)
# - Content: List of airport identifiers in various formats ['DAB', 'EWR', 'X50', 'AL44', etc.]
# - Purpose: Used for bulk airport ID processing and validation
#
# RESTRUCTURING NOTE:
# - This file stayed in core/pkl/ (not moved to data/) because it's tightly coupled
#   with core airport processing functionality, unlike general data files
```

### 6. **core/WIPs/WIP_bulk_weather_extractor.py** - Weather Data Extractor
**Lines 94-109:** Added detailed 17-line inline comments:
```python
# RESTRUCTURING UPDATE: Path corrected during project cleanup (October 2025)
# 
# WHAT CHANGED:
# - Path remains 'core/pkl/airport_identifiers_US.pkl' (no change needed)
# - File stays in core/pkl/ directory as it's core-specific functionality
# 
# WHY NO PATH CHANGE:
# - This file contains airport identifiers specifically for core weather processing
# - It's tightly coupled with weather extraction algorithms in this module
# - Keeping it in core/pkl/ maintains logical separation from general data files
# - Core-specific data stays with core functionality, general data moved to data/
```

### 7. **core/weather_fetch.py** - Weather Data Fetching
**Lines 90-107:** Added detailed 19-line inline comments:
```python
# RESTRUCTURING UPDATE: Path corrected during project cleanup (October 2025)
#
# WHAT CHANGED:
# - Path remains in core/pkl/ directory (no directory change)
# - Uses dynamic current working directory for compatibility
# - Removed old hardcoded absolute path
#
# WHY NO DIRECTORY CHANGE:
# - taf_positive_airports.pkl contains weather-specific airport codes
# - This data is tightly coupled with weather processing functionality
# - Keeping it in core/pkl/ maintains logical separation:
#   * General data files -> data/ directory
#   * Core weather functionality data -> core/pkl/ directory
```

### 8. **services/search_service.py** - Search Service
**Lines 15-17:** Added path update with comments:
```python
# RESTRUCTURING UPDATE: Path updated to point to data/ directory (October 2025)

qc = QueryClassifier(icao_file_path="../data/unique_icao.pkl")
```

### 9. **services/flight_aggregator_service.py** - Flight Aggregator Service
**Lines 10-12:** Added path update with comments:
```python

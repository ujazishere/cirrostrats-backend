# Project Restructuring Log - October 2025

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive cleanup and restructuring performed on the Cirrostrats backend project to improve organization, maintainability, and follow FastAPI best practices.

## What Was Done

### 1. Files Removed and Reorganized

**Development Files Removed:**

- `dcub.bat` - Development batch script (removed as unnecessary)

**Jupyter Notebooks (Organized):**

- `notebooks/Misc.ipynb` - Development/testing notebook (moved to notebooks/ directory)
- `notebooks/edct-poc.ipynb` - EDCT proof of concept notebook (moved to notebooks/ directory)
- `notebooks/mongo.ipynb` - MongoDB testing notebook (moved to notebooks/ directory)
- `notebooks/search-index.ipynb` - Search functionality testing notebook (moved to notebooks/ directory)

**Note:** Import paths in notebooks need to be updated to reflect new location. See `notebooks/README.md` for detailed migration guide.

**Documentation Reorganization:**

- `TODO.txt` - Moved to `docs/` directory for better organization

### 2. Directory Structure Created

**New Directories:**

- **`data/`** - Centralized location for all general data files
- **`docs/`** - Documentation and project notes
- **`notebooks/`** - Jupyter notebooks for development and experimentation

**Existing Structure Maintained:**

- `core/` - Core business logic (kept existing structure)
- `routes/` - API route definitions
- `services/` - Business service layer
- `models/` - Data models
- `schema/` - API schemas
- `utils/` - Utility functions
- `config/` - Configuration files

### 3. Data File Organization

**Files Moved to `data/` Directory:**

- `airports.json` (797KB) - Airport data in JSON format
- `all_US_airports_dict.pkl` (700KB) - US airports dictionary
- `bulk_weather_returns_mock.pkl` (512KB) - Mock weather data
- `forMDB.pkl` (1.3KB) - MongoDB related data
- `mock_ajms_data.pkl` (12KB) - Mock AJMS data
- `publicuj_searches_unique_sorts.pkl` (17KB) - Search data
- `unique_icao.pkl` (6KB) - Unique ICAO codes

**Files Kept in `core/pkl/` (Core-Specific):**

- Core functionality pickle files remain in their specialized location
- These files are tightly coupled with core business logic

### 4. Path Updates and File Modifications

**Files Updated with New Paths:**

**`core/extras/airports_export.py`:**

- **Line 16:** Updated hardcoded absolute path to relative path
- **Before:** `r'C:\Users\ujasv\OneDrive\Desktop\codes\cirrostrats-backend\all_US_airports_dict.pkl'`
- **After:** `r'../../data/all_US_airports_dict.pkl'`
- **Reason:** Removed user-specific hardcoded path, made portable

**`core/WIPs/WIP_airport_ID_bulk.py`:**

- **Lines 15-16:** Updated Django and external paths for airport dictionary
- **Lines 18-19:** Updated paths for airport identifiers
- **Before:** `'dj_app/root/pkl/'` and `'dj/dj_app/root/pkl/'`
- **After:** `'../../data/'` for general data, `'../pkl/'` for core data
- **Reason:** Aligned with new directory structure

**`core/WIPs/WIP_bulk_weather_extractor.py`:**

- **Line 93:** Corrected path for airport identifiers
- **Reason:** Ensured correct reference to core-specific data

**`core/weather_fetch.py`:**

- **Line 89:** Updated TAF positive airports path
- **Reason:** Maintained reference to core-specific weather data

### 5. New Files Created

**`.env.example`:**

- Environment variables template
- Replaces scattered environment documentation
- Provides clear setup instructions
- Includes all required configuration variables

**`docs/RESTRUCTURING_LOG.md`:**

- This documentation file
- Records all changes made during restructuring

### 6. Documentation Updates

**`README.md` - Complete Rewrite:**

- Added clear project structure diagram
- Organized setup instructions (Docker vs local development)
- Added API documentation links
- Included MongoDB setup guide
- Added feature overview
- Fixed all markdown linting issues

## Why These Changes Were Made

### Problems Solved

1. **Scattered Data Files:** Data files were mixed with code, making organization unclear
2. **Hardcoded Paths:** Absolute paths made the project non-portable
3. **Poor Documentation:** Setup instructions were unclear and scattered
4. **No Environment Template:** Environment variables were documented inline

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Better Organization:** Clear separation of concerns with logical directory structure
2. **Improved Portability:** Relative paths work across different environments
3. **Better Onboarding:** Clear README and environment setup
4. **Production Ready:** Professional structure suitable for deployment

## File Path Logic

### Relative Path Strategy

- **From `core/extras/`** to `data/`: `../../data/`
- **From `core/WIPs/`** to `data/`: `../../data/`
- **From `core/WIPs/`** to `core/pkl/`: `../pkl/`
- **From project root** to `core/pkl/`: `core/pkl/`

### Data File Categories

- **General Data** (`data/` directory): Airport data, mock data, general datasets
- **Core-Specific Data** (`core/pkl/` directory): Weather processing data, core algorithm data

## Impact on Development

### Positive Changes

- Easier to find and organize files
- Clearer project structure for new developers
- Better separation of data and code
- Improved documentation and setup process
- More professional and maintainable codebase

### Compatibility

- All existing functionality preserved
- API endpoints unchanged
- Core business logic unaffected
- Only file paths and organization improved

## Future Recommendations

1. **Environment Management:** Consider using python-decouple for better environment variable handling
2. **Data Management:** Consider moving large data files to external storage or database
3. **Testing:** Add comprehensive tests for all path-dependent functionality
4. **CI/CD:** Set up automated testing to catch path-related issues
5. **Documentation:** Keep this restructuring log updated with future changes

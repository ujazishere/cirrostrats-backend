query Tracking:
the raw search query submit should be processed within query classifier and have a function named `frontend formatter`.
    This can be reused by the useSuggestion's search_suggestion function in the backend to display ran out searches.


June 13
Frontend receives first 500 of the 3500 searchtem index collection(csti).
As the query progresses in the searchbar its suppose to match the remaining.
but then when its low it should use parse query using the frontend formatter that directs the query to its dedicated collection,
    again to send it to frontend with limit of upto 500 items at a time.
The formatter is what I need help with primarily since its suppose to send formatted data frontend for drop down suggestions as well as
    its supposed to parse_query the raw submits from the frontend, format and deliver the data to the frontend.


So the submit should deliver the actually collection data to the frontend?
and suggestions should deliver the display name only?

Both contains display name for the frontend. The difference is raw submit will contain full flightnumber or airportID  for frontend fetching.

*******VVI*********
So essentially raw submit should ***query the collection*** based on parseQuery and submit that to the frontend.?
    But wait, that doesn't make sense since raw flightnumber or code is needed for the frontend to perform live api fetch.
    So keep it?
    Dropdown selection of the suggestion has similar functionality where it sends just the mongoID or flightnumber/nnumber from csti.
*******************

Finally,
Know and document csti format. Not just that, document the formatting of all the collections in mock test data-- This will give your visibility.

    Get the ATIS to update periodically, set up notifications when updates fail.

    ***MAKE RELIABLE DATA FETCHING A PRIORITY*** -- In the mean time you can use aviation stack, flightRadar and flightAware - 
        multiple free accounts to increase requests and track the exhaustion of requests.

        ***IT IS CRITICAL TO GET PROPER SOURCE OF FLIGHT DATA. JMS MAY BE THE DEAL BREAKER. fetching all departures on many major airports just doesn't seem feasable.***
    Not practicle with scraping: Currently working on fetching flight numbers and their associated information from flight-stats.com, and any other web.
    continuous weather, gate and flight_number data fetching and saving on mdb. setting up checkpoints to notify of ill behaved fetching.
    Currently working on the gate scrape. - Works need to have it fetch consistently, fix date format issues and aesthetics.
    
    logic to consistently pull and save.
        Current weather based on airports in the database, Save them in the mdb collection `Weather` for access into the main collection and create index.
            Also account for test data in the collection.
            If there  is one server that consistently pulls weather there wont be a need to have another one for testing instance. It would automatically fetch from the legacy server.
                So maybe distribute tasks via container orchestration- one container for python fetching and backend, one for celery, one for react.
            weather scheduler:
                # TODO VHP: implement health checks such that  if things are not updating/returns are not consistent OR health check gets pushed out to devops as notifications.
                # inefficiency:- Airports that return null consistently should be fetched less frequently.
                # Track airports that are trending frequent updates and update them frequently and ones that dont update much should be fetched less fequently. This will be a milestone in efficiency.

        current flight numbers and their details.
        some sort of ping and save to databse to access in the frontend.
    
    
    Indexing can be done after the data is fetched.

    clean up code. clean up the mess: separate scraping, add notes all along
    Use .env file rather than the switch and auth. Move django contents over(from where to where?).

crawl for all flight numbers and their associated information from flight-stats.com
Need to setup CORS middleware for Fastapi. it usses `app` and the logic uses router. Check for compatibility.
configure vite.config.js in frontend to reflect what is on AWS.

implement continuous weather extractor twice a month and send email.
    store typical searches server side for quick access and use celery for event update checks:
        for gates scrapes, weather updates for most used airports, 
        implement async for parrallel/multi level processing of tasks instead of typical syncronous,series wise, step by step operation.
    Implement ML and NN. X vs ground truth vals.

fix massive bug on flight_aware route date time conflict with real scheduled_time.
    maybe include search with date, time or display info with date as zulu time
    currently it senses the most recent route that is not None type probs giving future date
    use: if scheduled_out is current_utc and route is not none:
        but current utc date_time has source latency.   
Fix bug that takes in 2 flight routes for singular flight number.
    Add option to scroll left and right for dates.
    Load data incrementally so as to avoid waiting for all data to be fetched.

Add these query words and functionality to chat :
    weather_range = ['met ', ' met', ' met ', 'met', 'taf ', ' taf', ' taf ', 'taf', 'weather', 'metar', 'metar ']               

Extract all airports D-Atis info during all weather conditinos for analyses and classification
    Add thunderstorm, freezing and such symbols on title.
    Add departure/approach runways in use.
integrate EDCT info  from https://www.fly.faa.gov/edct/jsp/edctLookUp.jsp
    ask then faa guys you have been reaching out to for jms issue

Remove sql database and create own for seamless lightweight version in case mdb goes out.
Fix up weather page and include ability to pull multiple airports
Understand and configure mongoDB.

Airport based recommendations: hotel, restaurents, things to do, etc.
runways and winds
frequencies for the airport.

Machine learning Logic:
        "{gate} for {partial/complete airport ID/name}" = "{gate} {airport}"
        "{gate} for {partial/complete airport name}" = "{gate} {airport}"   
        "weather for {partial/complete airport} = "{metar} {airport}"
        "{airport_id} {gate}" = "{gate} {airport}"
        "{flight number} weather" = "{metar} {departure airport} {destination airport}"
        "{flight number} destination" = return destination or destination
        "{flight number} not, notam, notams" = return notams for departure and destination. include ability to return just pertinant information.

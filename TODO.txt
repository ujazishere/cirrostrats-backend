    Use .env file rather than the switch and auth. Move contents over.


    
Need to setup CORS middleware for Fastapi. it usses `app` and the logic uses router. Check for compatibility.
configure vite.config.js in frontend to reflect what is on AWS.

The problem probably lies in the frontend trying to gain access from nginx IP or rather the public IP of the instance and
the code is configured for only local access that works on only local machine with localhost and 127.0.0.1 since the public ip wont
have access to those local IP ports.

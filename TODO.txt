    When searched UA4186 followup with `flight status`, `EDCT`, or `weather` or `datis` for auto completion and suggestions. use 3 flight status, maybe show delay info, grou
    
    logic to consistently pull 
        Current weather based on airports in the database, Save them in the mdb collection `Weather` for access into the main collection and create index.
            Also account for test data in the collection.
            If there  is one server that consistently pulls weather there wont be a need to have another one for testing instance. It would automatically fetch from the legacy server.
            weather scheduler:
                # implement health checks such that  if things are not updating I get notified or health check gets pushed out to devops
                # inefficiency:- Airports that return null consistently should be fetched less frequently.
                # Track airports that are trending frequent updates and update them frequently and ones that dont update much should be fetched less fequently. This will be a milestone in efficiency.

        current flight numbers and their details.
        some sort of ping and save to databse to access in the frontend.





    clean up code. clean up the mess: separate scraping, add notes all along
    Use .env file rather than the switch and auth. Move django contents over.

Need to setup CORS middleware for Fastapi. it usses `app` and the logic uses router. Check for compatibility.
configure vite.config.js in frontend to reflect what is on AWS.

implement continuous weather extractor twice a month and send email.
    store typical searches server side for quick access and use celery for event update checks:
        for gates scrapes, weather updates for most used airports, 
        implement async for parrallel/multi level processing of tasks instead of typical syncronous,series wise, step by step operation.
    Implement ML and NN. X vs ground truth vals.

fix massive bug on flight_aware route date time conflict with real scheduled_time.
    maybe include search with date, time or display info with date as zulu time
    currently it senses the most recent route that is not None type probs giving future date
    use: if scheduled_out is current_utc and route is not none:
        but current utc date_time has source latency.   
Extract all airports D-Atis info during all weather conditinos for analyses and classification
    Add thunderstorm, freezing and such symbols on title.
    Add departure/approach runways in use.
integrate EDCT info  from https://www.fly.faa.gov/edct/jsp/edctLookUp.jsp
    ask then faa guys you have been reaching out to for jms issue

Remove sql database and create own for seamless lightweight version.
Fix up weather page and include ability to pull multiple airports
Understand and configure mongoDB

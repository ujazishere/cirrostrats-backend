## 🚨 Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Environment Variables
- Never commit API keys, passwords, or secrets
- Use `.env` files locally (ensure they're in `.gitignore`)
- Use environment variable templates (`.env.example`)

### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review new dependencies for security issues
- Use `npm audit` or equivalent tools regularly
- Pin dependency versions in production

- Follow secure authentication practices

## 🔍 Security Scanning

We use the following tools to maintain security:

- **Dependency Scanning**: GitHub Dependabot / Snyk / npm audit
- **Code Analysis**: CodeQL / SonarQube / ESLint security rules
- **Container Scanning**: Docker security scanning (if applicable)
- **Secret Detection**: GitLeaks / TruffleHog
